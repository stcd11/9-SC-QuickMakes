- We can create diffent tones by creating different frequencies.
- In the previous project(The Egg Timer) you learned about 555 timer circuits.
- These circuits can produce pulses which change in frequency.

[[./img/555circuit.jpg]]
- Try building the circuit above using circuit wizard.
- Change the values of R2 and see how it affects the speed at which the LED flashes.
** Build It

- Below is the full circuit diagram. if you have time, you can try design one yourself. 
[[./img/fullcircuit555.jpg]]
- Your circuit board will look like this.
[[./img/Eggtimercwz.jpg]]
- As usual, always start building with the smallest components first (the resistors).
- Once you have finished your PCB, it should look like this.
** Build It

- The housing parts have been precut for you, you will just need to mount your PCB in the box.
- *Make sure you test your egg timer before installing into the box.*

*** Silver
- Paste a screenshot of your 555 timer circuit you designed and paste it into the word document (Or upload the picture directly).
- Explain what happened when you changed the value of R2.  
*** Gold
- Upload photos of the front and back of your project.
- Your solder joints are good, some dry joints or excess solder.
- You component placement is good, a few of the components are off the board and not aligned correctly.
*** Platinum
- Upload pictures of your completed, working project in the housing. This has been put together to a high standard.
