- Boiling an egg requires perfect timing.
- There are many ways to create a timing circuit, but one of the simplest ways is to use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC][555 timer]] circuit.
- The 555 timer circuit relies on a basic electronic timing circuit which uses resistors and capacitors to create differnt time lengths.
- The capacitor take times to charge, we can use this to create a time delay.
- We can calculate the time delay using a simple formula, t = R x C.

[[./img/555circuit.jpg]]
- Try building the circuit above using circuit wizard.
- Change the values of R2 and see how it affects the speed at which the LED flashes.
** Build It

- Below is the full circuit diagram. if you have time, you can try design one yourself. 
[[./img/fullcircuit555.jpg]]
- Your circuit board will look like this.
[[./img/Eggtimercwz.jpg]]
- You will need to add wires to the LED's, switch and Potentiometer (variable resistor).
[[./img/Wiresadded.jpg]]
- You can now add these parts to your PCB, along with all the components.
- Your final PCB should look like this.

- The housing parts have been pre-cut for you, you will just need to mount your PCB in the box.
[[./img/MDFparts.jpg]]
-  *Make sure you test your egg timer before installing into the box.*
- First you will need to add the parts to the lid.
- Starting with the LED's. These will need LED clips.
[[./img/LEdclips1.jpg]]
[[./img/LEDclips2.jpg]]
[[./img/LEDclips3.jpg]]
- You can then simply screw on the potentiometer and switch.
- *Before you add the potentiometer, you will need to break off the tag using a pair of long nose pliers.*
[[./img/POTtag1.jpg]]
[[./img/POTtag2.jpg]]
- Your lid should now be ready to fit to the rest of the box.
[[./img/Partsfitted.jpg]]
- First you will need to glue the bottom of the box together.
- *Make sure the parts are the correct way around.*
- Use masking tape to hold the parts together, wait till the glue is dry before fitting the top.
[[./img/Boxstep1.jpg]]
- Once the glue is dry, you can fit the lid with the PCB and test it again. 
- The finished product should look like this.

*** Silver
- Paste a screenshot of your 555 timer circuit you designed and paste it into the word document (Or upload the picture directly).
- Explain what happened when you changed the value of R2.  
*** Gold
- Upload photos of the front and back of your project.
- Your solder joints are good, some dry joints or excess solder.
- You component placement is good, a few of the components are off the board and not aligned correctly.
*** Platinum
- Upload pictures of your completed, working project in the housing. This has been put together to a high standard.
